## A crypto wallet for regular people

YC - we have made a demo wallet for Garry Tan that's already signed in and verified. In normal practice, users go through a regular Jumio / Onfido government-supplied ID check as part of signup. 

The account has $5.00 real USDC, and you can send the money anywhere you want. 

 - To see what sending money looks like, try sending to the the address `6PCANXw778iMrBzLUVK4c9q6Xc2X9oRUCvLoa4tfsLWG` - your friend Vaheh says this is their Solana account. Let's find out if this is true!
