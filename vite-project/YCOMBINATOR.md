Hi YCombinator! We've made a quick demo of Portal for you. 

**You can use this to send real money to identified recipients anywhere in the world instantly.**

## Sending money
 
We have made a demo wallet for Jared Friedman that's already signed in and verified. Normally, users go through a regular Jumio / Onfido government-supplied ID check as part of signup, to get verified, we've saved you the time for this demo! 

The account has $5.00 real USDC, and you can send the money anywhere you want. 

 - To see what sending money looks like, try sending to the address `6PCANXw778iMrBzLUVK4c9q6Xc2X9oRUCvLoa4tfsLWG` - your friend Vaheh says this is their Solana account. Let's find out if this is true! 

You can send USDC to Vaheh's wallet, and know it's really him, entirely on the block chain. 

 - If someone doesn't have a the required Portal Token, say `` you can either invite them to get verified, or send them money anyway.
