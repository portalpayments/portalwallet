# Coding Guidelines

Some basic coding guidelines to look for when reviewing code.

These are focused on keeping us moving quickly and staying motivated.

## Code is written more than it is read

- You're writing code to be be read, understood, and changed by your colleagues.

- Use real names for things. No abbreviations - if we're searchng fot 'wallet', then 'wlt' wont up and abbeviations are invariably used inconsistently. Let the compiler worry about saving characters.

## Don't prematurely optimise

- Favour readability and simplicity over speed unless speed becoems an issue. Which it probably won't.

## Copy on first paste

This lets us refactor easily.

## Let tools worry about linting and let's talk about building things.

We use prettier with the default rules.
