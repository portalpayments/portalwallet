# Portal Wallet - YCombinator Demo

Hi YCombinator! We've made a quick demo of Portal for you.

**You can use this to send real money to identified recipients anywhere in the world instantly.**

## Installing the extension

Normally Portal is installed through the Chrome Web Store (or Edge Web Store etc). But for this demo we'll install it the old fashioned way.

Download an unzip the the file provided.

Then in Chrome, click the three dot menu **â‹®** then **Manage Extensions**:

## Sending money

We have made a demo wallet for Jared Friedman that's already signed in and verified. Normally, users go through a regular Jumio / Onfido government-supplied ID check as part of signup, to get verified, we've saved you the time for this demo!

The account has $10.00 real USDC, and you can send the money anywhere you want.

**Some things to try**

- Someone online says they're your friend Vaheh says `6PCANXw778iMrBzLUVK4c9q6Xc2X9oRUCvLoa4tfsLWG` is their Solana account. Let's find out if this is true! Try sending to that address.

You can send USDC to Vaheh's wallet, and know it's really him, entirely on the block chain.

- If someone doesn't have the required Portal Token, say Kevin Rose `3ikkFnEDBvUXPHfCmvXma4qBGZxMooveQ5eM6LLQgeuQ` you can either invite them to get verified, or send them money anyway.

## Note

There's a few parts - particular the onboarding workflow -that we're still working on.
